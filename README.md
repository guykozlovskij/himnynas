### Hymnal

I created this website within a week to provide easy access to hymns for a Christian group in Lithuania. The site is intentionally light and simple, constructed solely with HTML and CSS to serve as a proof of concept for a bigger project. 

The original website deployment can be found here -> [himnynas.vercel.app](https://himnynas.vercel.app/)

The PWA followup repo -> [github.com/guykozlovskij/hymnal-v2](https://github.com/guykozlovskij/hymnal-v2)
